# IoT-Enabled-Missile-Health-Monitoring-System
The IoT-Enabled Missile Health Monitoring System is a cutting-edge solution that uses IoT technology for real-time monitoring and diagnostics to guarantee the dependability and security of missile systems. It incorporates sensors to monitor vital characteristics such the performance of electrical subsystems, propulsion system temperature and pressure, and structural vibrations. After being processed and sent to a cloud-based platform, this data is examined and displayed on operator-friendly dashboards. By spotting any problems before they become serious, the technology lowers the chance of mission failure and offers predictive maintenance capabilities. In order to guarantee ideal operational conditions, it also keeps an eye on the environment while being stored and transported. This system allows for cost-effective maintenance and diagnostics while improving the operational efficiency, safety, and dependability of missile systems with features including remote monitoring capabilities and real-time notifications for anomalies.
